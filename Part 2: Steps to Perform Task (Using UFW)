Step 1: Check Current Firewall Status
Before applying any changes, check the current firewall status:
sudo ufw status verbose
This will display whether UFW is active or inactive, and show the existing rules.

----

Step 2: Block Inbound Traffic on a Specific Port
For example, if you want to block inbound traffic on port 23 (Telnet), use the following command:
sudo ufw deny in 23
This will prevent any incoming Telnet connections.

----

Step 3: Test the Block Rule
To test the rule, you can try to connect to port 23 (Telnet) locally:
telnet localhost 23
If the firewall is working, the connection should be refused.

----

Step 4: Allow SSH (Port 22)
If you need remote access to your Kali machine via SSH, allow traffic on port 22:
sudo ufw allow in 22
This ensures that SSH connections are not blocked.

----

Step 5: Remove the Block Rule
If you want to remove the block rule on port 23, run:
sudo ufw delete deny in 23

----

Step 6: Enable UFW (if it was not enabled)
If UFW was inactive, enable it with the following command:
sudo ufw enable
