Step 1: Save the Firewall Rules to a Text File
To create a configuration file with your applied firewall rules, run the following command:
sudo ufw status verbose > firewall_rules.txt
This command will redirect the output of the ufw status verbose command into a file called firewall_rules.txt.

------

Step 2: Verify the File Contents
You can view the contents of the file to ensure the rules have been saved correctly. To display the file contents in the terminal, use:
cat firewall_rules.txt
Alternatively, open it in a text editor like nano:
nano firewall_rules.txt
Example Output in firewall_rules.txt:
To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
22                         ALLOW       Anywhere
23                         DENY        Anywhere

-----

Step 3: Submit or Share the Configuration File
Now that the firewall rules are saved, you can submit or share the firewall_rules.txt file. Depending on your project or assignment requirements, you can either upload it or email it.
